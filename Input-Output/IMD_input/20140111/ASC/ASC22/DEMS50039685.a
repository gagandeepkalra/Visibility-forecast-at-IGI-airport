Model Assessment and Emphasis
Issue 110900
1. Changes in emphasis: Nil sig
2. Emphasis:
Wintry  showers  in N/NW becoming confined to N Scotland  by  afternoon.
Elsewhere dry with plenty of sunshine. Rather cold.
Tonight: Most places dry and clear. Temperatures falling quickly, giving
a  widespread frost. Some fog/freezing fog patches forming in  central/E
areas, perhaps locally dense.
Sunday:  Another cold start. Fog lifting/clearing fairly  readily,  then
some sunshine in the E/NE before cloud and winds increase from the W  to
bring rain later. Feeling cold.

4. Uncertainties and amplifying remarks

Analysis and early stages
There  are still problems in both the GM and NAE with their handling  of
the  developing Low in mid-Atlantic, and also with the wave close to the
Azores.  The  latter  becomes entrained within the warm  sector  of  the
former, so neither error has any significant impact on UK weather today,
and  just  contribute  to timing uncertainties in the  front's  progress
eastwards on Sunday night. Of the two, the GM has the best fit.  NAE  is
still a bit faster than the GM/E4 than other models as the front reaches
northern areas later tomorrow but for the time being the slower solution
is followed.

Closer  to home, the models are performing well with the showers feeding
into  N/NW  areas - in particular the more organised showers  across  NW
England associated with the rearward portion of the upper trough.  These
likely to be falling as snow on high ground. Further showers of a wintry
mix  continuing across W Scotland (and N Ireland at first)  giving  snow
accs on high ground.

Occln and residual damp weather in the SE should clear this morning.

A  few  fog patches likely to develop/redevelop in clearer areas  across
the  north this morning, particularly NI following the trough. Any which
do form lhese lingering until late morning.


Evolution

As  the  occlusion  moves away SE, a sharpening upper trough  runs  east
across  northern  and  some central areas this  morning,  bringing  deep
instability  and low WBPTs across NW areas. This airmass is the  heavily
modified  remains of the cold air outbreak across North America,  though
by  now  WBPTs  have  increased to around PS02, with  further  snow-fall
becoming  confined to ground above around 250m.    As the  axis  of  the
upper  trough  begins  to move away, there is a rapid  rise  in  contour
heights  from  west this afternoon which quickly builds a surface  ridge
and  confines the wintry showers to NW then far N Scotland.   The  ridge
makes only slow progress east across the UK tonight and tomorrow, before
a  freshening and increasingly cyclonic S/SE flow ushers in frontal rain
from the west later on Sunday.

The  upper ridge amplifies as a result of the major trough extension  in
mid-Atlantic. This has begun to develop a complex, multi-centred Low  to
the  NW of the Azores this morning. As mentioned above, models have been
struggling  somewhat with the detail of this system, though luckily  the
continued  backing  of the steering flow takes it  (and  its  associated
heavy rain and strong winds) NNE towards Iceland tomorrow.

Precipitation

Deep instability at first in the NW will steadily stabilize though today
as  contour  heights  rise  but instability still  indicated  to  around
14000ft  in the far NW mid afternoon giving further showers but snowfall
estricted to high ground by then.

Rainfall amounts on the occluding system tomorrow not expected to cause
any sig issues -  totals in the west locally of the order 10-15mm on
upslopes.  Snow is likely on Grampians nad NW Highlands late tomorrow as
frontal ppn comes in - amounts uncertain.

Winds  See below.

Temps/ice/fog
Ice risk rest of this morning this morning in N and parts of the west.
either from a freeze after frontal clearance, from showers feeding in
over frozen surfaces, or where there is seepage from recent wet weather
onto roads. Yellow warning in force - though note some icy patches still
possible in the NE too.

Max temps today near normal in S, but below/cold in parts of N Scotland
(where the coldest air lingers) or NI (where fog may be slow to clear in
places).

A more widespread frost tonight - giving icy patches where seepage still
occurring.  Mins loc MS3 to MS4C inland. Some fog/fzfog also likely in
the ridge axis, especially E England. This likely to be fairly shallow,
but may be locally dense with patches more frequent than we have seen
for a while. NAE, UKV has surprisingly little given slack gradoients,
wet ground and fog points probably just below zero.  E4 has more -
perhaps too much so reduced slightly for modified fields.  Should also
lift/clear from the S late in the night as cloud encroaches and
gradients increase, with any remaining fog in E England lasting a bit
longer but larely clearing  mid-morning tomorrow. However, some residual
stratus could persist in NE England.  Increasing cloud and wind, Sunday
will feel decidedly cold across many areas

Latest guidance for ongoing river and ground water flooding:
The FGS is now reflecting residual river and groundwater flooding
impacts following recent heavy rainfall.

There is an ongoing MEDIUM likelihood of significant disruption in
places during the next 5 days. The significant river flooding impacts
are on the large, slower responding river Thames, with minor impacts on
the river Severn. There is also, significant flooding in the Somerset
Levels. Parts of Dorset and south Wiltshire have continuing significant
groundwater flooding, and significant groundwater flooding is now also
possible in east Hampshire with further minor groundwater flooding in
parts of West Sussex.

Catchments remain responsive to further rainfall, particularly in the
south of England. At this stage however, it is not anticipated that
rainfall during the next 5 days will add to the current disruption.

For more local details on the flood risk, please refer to the
Environment Agency web site or call the Flood Line number 0845 988 1188.
