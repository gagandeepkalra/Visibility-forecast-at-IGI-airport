REMARKS:
112100Z POSITION NEAR 22.9S 173.1W.
TROPICAL CYCLONE 07P (IAN), LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 506 NM SOUTH-
SOUTHWEST OF PAGO PAGO, HAS TRACKED SOUTH-SOUTHEASTWARD AT 09
KNOTS OVER THE PAST SIX HOURS. ANIMATED INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY
SHOWS A HIGHLY SYMMETRICAL SYSTEM THAT HAS SUSTAINED ITS CURRENT
INTENSITY AS WELL AS MAINTAINED A 19-NM EYE. THE INITIAL POSITION IS
BASED ON THE ABOVE ANIMATION AND LINES UP WITH THE MICROWAVE EYE ON
AN 111857Z SSMI-S PASS. THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS BASED ON CONGRUENT
DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM PGTW, PHFO, AND KNES. UPPER LEVEL ANALYSIS
INDICATES THE TRANSITORY MID-LATITUDE TROUGH TO THE SOUTH HAS
CONTINUED TO ENHANCE THE POLEWARD OUTFLOW AND ALLOWED THE SYSTEM TO
SUSTAIN THE CURRENT INTENSITY DESPITE DETERIORATING ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS. TC IAN IS EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY WEAKEN AS IT ENCOUNTERS
FURTHER INCREASING VERTICAL WIND SHEAR AND COOLER SSTS ALONG THE
POLEWARD TRACK. THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO BEGIN EXTRA-TROPICAL
TRANSITION (ETT) BY TAU 48 AND COMPLETE THE ETT BY TAU 72 AS A COLD
CORE LOW. THERE IS HIGH CONFIDENCE IN THE FORECAST TRACK DUE TO THE
TIGHT AGREEMENT AMONG THE NUMERIC MODELS. MAXIMUM SIGNIFICANT WAVE
HEIGHT AT 111800Z IS 33 FEET. NEXT WARNINGS AT 120900Z AND 122100Z.
